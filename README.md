# Towards-Low-Energy-and-Adaptable-Prosthetics-through-Spiking-Networks
An undergraduate research project into test time adaption of a classifer of transradial EMG data using SNN. This research focuses on the generalisation to unseen data (ie subject outside the dataset). The dataset used is the Ninapro DB6 and the work builds upon the SNNTorch framework.
