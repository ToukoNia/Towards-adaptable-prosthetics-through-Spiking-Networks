# Towards-Low-Energy-and-Adaptable-Prosthetics-through-Spiking-Networks
The loss of a limb is a traumatic experience that can significantly hinder a person's ability to perform daily tasks. Current research into neuroprosthetic devices has demonstrated that they can be controlled via processing non-invasive electromyographic (EMG) signals recorded from a subject's forearm by leveraging machine learning (ML) models. However, these models have limitations that make them impractical for prosthetic devices.
 
Firstly, EMG signals are inherently non-stationary, experiencing statistical shifts over time due to factors such as electrode placement and muscle fatigue. These ML models are typically trained once and then deployed, failing to capture these shifts and resulting in performance degradation that renders them unsuitable for the long-term use required by prosthetic devices. Secondly, the conventional models require significant computational power, which severely drains the prosthetic's battery, compromising the all-day use required of such devices.
 	
This research addresses these challenges by proposing a control system based on recurrent spiking neural networks (SNN) to create a more robust and power-efficient solution. Spiking neural networks have been shown to be significantly more efficient due to their event-driven communication, an advantage that is massively amplified when implemented on specialised neuromorphic hardware. To overcome the shifting signal, the SNN will be integrated with a continual learning test-time adaption strategy, allowing it to overcome the statistical shifts in the data and maintain the performance over time. The proposed model was developed and evaluated on the Ninapro DB6 dataset, which is widely recognised in the literature as a challenging benchmark.
